Tonight's homework has some practice with all the things we did today! We'll do some loops, we'll do some conditionals, we'll mess with some objects, all those good things.

You'll see a couple of files in here --
- [Loops & Conditionals](./loops-conditionals.md)
- [Objects](./objects.md)

There are instructions for you to follow in both of those. You will put all of your work in `answers.js` (this already exists in this repository).

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- Your `answers.js` has been filled out!!!
- Your `hammonds-mines.js` has been filled out!!!

- A link submitted to the appropriate assignment on [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/w/MTI4MTM1MjgyNDYw/t/all).
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.
